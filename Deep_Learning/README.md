# Deep Learning :brain:

I took the course Deep Learning (IIC3697) in the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC) and here are all of my evaluations. I developed different projects all relationated with neural networks. Here a summary.

**Homework 1:** Here I used a neuronal network pretrained and I tested it with different images and also I modified the structure of this neuronal network and I pretrained it with a dataset of racoons to detect racoons on images with its respective "anchor box". I used mainly *Convolutional Neuronal Network*. :raccoon:
