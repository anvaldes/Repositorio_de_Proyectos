# Deep Learning :brain:

I took the course Deep Learning (IIC3697) in the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC) and here are all of my evaluations. I developed different projects all relationated with neural networks. Here a summary.

**Homework 1:** Here I used a neuronal network pretrained and I tested it with different images and also I modified the structure of this neuronal network and I pretrained it with a dataset of racoons to detect racoons on images with its respective "anchor box". In this homework I used mainly *Convolutional Neuronal Network (CNN)*. :raccoon:

**Homework 2:** Here I used "embedding" techniques to transform text to vectors and this way I could to train a neuronal network that it detected spam maild. Then I used a siamese neuronal network to determine the symilarity between two words. In this homework I used mainly *Recurrent Neuronal Network (RNN)*. :capital_abcd:

**Homework 3:** Here I used "Reinforcement Learning" to teach a neuronal network to play the Atari game called "Enduro". In this homework I used mainly *Dueling DQN Model*. :joystick:
